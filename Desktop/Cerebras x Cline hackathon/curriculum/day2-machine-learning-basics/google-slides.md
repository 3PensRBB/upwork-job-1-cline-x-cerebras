# Day 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals - Google Slides Content

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title**: How Machines Learn  
**Subtitle**: Building Smarter Algorithms That Understand Us  
**Visual**: Cartoon computer learning from student drawings  
**Notes**:  
- Start with "Yesterday we saw how AI can be biased. Today we'll learn HOW it learns!"  
- Connect to students' social media experiences

## Slide 2: Programming vs Machine Learning
**Content**:  
"Traditional Programming: Rules → Computer → Answers  
Machine Learning: Answers → Computer → Rules"  
**Visual**: Side-by-side comparison diagram  
**Examples**:  
- Calculator (programmed rules)  
- TikTok recommendations (learned patterns)  
**Notes**:  
- Use whiteboard to demonstrate both approaches  
- Ask: "Which would be harder to program with rules: a calculator or TikTok?"

## Slide 3: The Learning Process
**Visual**: Simple ML pipeline graphic  
**Content**:  
"Machine Learning in 4 Steps:  
1. **Data**: Examples (like photos of dogs)  
2. **Features**: Important details (ears, tail, size)  
3. **Model**: Pattern recognition system  
4. **Predictions**: New outputs (is this a dog?)"  
**Analogy**:  
"Like learning to recognize friends by their features (hair, height, smile)"  
**Notes**:  
- Emphasize "features" as key concept  
- Connect to upcoming Scratch activity

## Slide 4: Interactive Demo
**Activity**: "Guess My Rule"  
**Process**:  
1. Teacher thinks of rule (e.g., "likes vegetables")  
2. Students provide examples (food items)  
3. Teacher says "yes" or "no"  
4. Class guesses the rule  
**Notes**:  
- Show how this mimics ML training  
- Highlight how more examples improve accuracy

## Slide 5: Social Media Case Study
**Visual**: Simplified Instagram interface with wellbeing metrics  
**Content**:  
- Platforms track: likes, shares, time spent  
- These metrics don't measure: happiness, focus, self-esteem  
**Discussion Prompt**:  
"What would happen if apps measured wellbeing instead of engagement?"  
**Notes**:  
- Keep statistics concrete but age-appropriate  
- Reference Instagram's internal research on teen mental health

## Slide 6: Algorithm Tuning
**Interactive Element**: Dual-slider visualization  
**Content**:  
"Adjust these settings:  
- **Engagement**: More likes, longer scrolling  
- **Wellbeing**: Positive content, breaks, diversity"  
**Prediction**:  
"Try to find the balance where users stay happy AND engaged"  
**Notes**:  
- Demonstrate extreme settings (all engagement = addictive)  
- Transition to hands-on activity

## Slide 7: Activity Instructions
**Scratch Healthy Algorithm Builder**  
**Steps**:  
1. Open project at [shortened link]  
2. Test different slider combinations  
3. Record outcomes for sample users  
**Data Table Template**:  
| User Profile | Engagement Score | Wellbeing Score |  
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|  
| Anxious teen | 90% | 40% |  
| Student needing help | 60% | 80% |  
**Notes**:  
- Demonstrate first test case together  
- Emphasize recording observations

## Slide 8: Reflection Prompt
**Big Question**:  
*"Design an algorithm that would make your favorite app healthier to use. What would it change?"*  
**Visual**: App icons with wellbeing symbols  
**Notes**:  
- Allow private sketching time first  
- Use "Think-Pair-Share" protocol as described in lesson plan

## Slide 9: Daily Challenge
**Homework**:  
"Track your app usage tonight:  
- When did you feel good using it?  
- When did you feel worse?  
- What would you change?"  
**Visual**: Smartphone with emotion tracker  
**Notes**:  
- Provide example: "I felt good when I learned something new on YouTube"  
- Collect responses at start of Day 3
