# Day 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how machine learning differs from traditional programming
- Identify key components of ML systems (data, features, predictions)
- Build a simple recommendation algorithm prototype in Scratch
- Analyze ethical implications of engagement-optimized algorithms

## Materials
- Computers with internet access
- [Scratch Recommendation Builder](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all)
- Projector for Google Slides presentation
- Printed "Algorithm Design Cards" (provided in resources)

## Lesson Flow (90 minutes)

### Introduction: How Machines Learn (20 min)
**Activity**:
1. **Recap** (5 min): "What did we learn about AI bias yesterday?"
2. **Google Slides**:
   - Contrast traditional programming vs ML ("Rules vs Learning")
   - Visualize training process: Data → Features → Model → Predictions
   - Interactive demo: "Guess the rule" game with student examples

### Hands-on: Building Recommendation Systems (30 min)
**Scratch Activity - Healthy Algorithm Builder**:
1. Load [pre-configured Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/987654321/)
2. Students adjust algorithm parameters:
   - Engagement slider (likes, shares, time spent)
   - Wellbeing slider (positive content, breaks, diversity)
3. Test with sample user profiles:
   - "Student who gets anxious from comparison"
   - "Student who needs educational content"
4. Class discussion: "How did changing sliders affect outcomes?"

*Teacher Tip*: Use printed Algorithm Design Cards for offline parameter tuning if internet is unstable

### Ethics Deep Dive: Social Media Impact (25 min)
**Case Study Implementation**:
1. Present Instagram mental health research (simplified findings)
2. Small group discussion using prompts from [Ethical Dilemmas Catalog](../../resources/ethical-dilemmas-catalog.md)
3. Role-play: "You're a social media designer - create an ethical algorithm framework"

### Reflection & Journaling (15 min)
**Prompt**:  
*"Design an algorithm that would make your favorite app healthier to use. What would it change?"*

**Sharing Protocol**:  
- Think: 3 minutes private design sketch
- Pair: Exchange ideas with partner
- Share: Groups present one key feature of their "healthy algorithm"

## Teacher Resources
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Scratch project not loading? Use offline version (download from resources)
  - Confusion about features? Show [this 3-min visual explainer](https://example.com/ml-basics)
- **Differentiation**:
  - Support: Provide pre-set parameter combinations to test
  - Challenge: Have students add new wellbeing metrics to the algorithm
- **Assessment**:
  - Exit ticket: "One way algorithms affect my life is..."
