# Day 5: Capstone Project - Designing Ethical AI Solutions

## Learning Objectives
- Synthesize knowledge from Days 1-4 into a cohesive project
- Design an AI solution addressing a real-world problem
- Incorporate ethical considerations into technical design
- Present and defend design choices to peers

## Materials
- Computers with internet access
- [Capstone Project Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyz123)
- Projector for Google Slides presentation
- Printed "Ethical Design Checklist" (provided in resources)
- Presentation rubric

## Lesson Flow (90 minutes)

### Introduction: The AI Designer's Challenge (20 min)
**Activity**:
1. **Recap** (5 min): "What was the most important ethical lesson from this week?"
2. **Google Slides**:
   - Review key concepts: bias, wellbeing, decision-making, privacy
   - Introduce capstone challenge: "Design an AI solution for your community"
   - Show examples: 
     * Deepfake detector for social media
     * Eco-friendly recommendation system
     * Accessibility tool for school

### Hands-on: Capstone Project Development (30 min)
**Design Sprint Activity**:
1. Students choose one ethical dilemma from catalog:
   - Deepfake Technology
   - Environmental Impact
   - Accessibility Tools
2. Using template, develop:
   - Problem statement
   - Technical approach (Scratch/Colab/Teachable Machine)
   - Ethical safeguards
   - Expected impact
3. Teacher circulates for guidance and troubleshooting

*Teacher Tip*: Provide sentence starters for students struggling with design concepts

### Ethics Deep Dive: Real-World Implementation (25 min)
**Case Study Implementation**:
1. Groups present initial designs to small peer circles
2. Feedback protocol:
   - "I like how you addressed [ethical concern]"
   - "Have you considered [potential bias]?"
   - "How might this affect [specific group]?"
3. Revise designs based on peer feedback

### Final Presentations & Reflection (15 min)
**Prompt**:  
*"Present your AI solution and explain how you made it ethical."*

**Presentation Structure**:
- 2 minutes per group
- Must include: problem, solution, ethical considerations
- Audience asks one ethical question per presentation

**Closing Reflection**:  
*"What will you remember about AI ethics one year from now?"*

## Teacher Resources
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Template not loading? Use offline version in resources
  - Design blocks? Provide additional case study examples
- **Differentiation**:
  - Support: Pre-defined problem scenarios with scaffolding
  - Challenge: Calculate potential societal impact metrics
- **Assessment**:
  - Rubric for: technical understanding, ethical integration, presentation
  - Peer feedback forms
