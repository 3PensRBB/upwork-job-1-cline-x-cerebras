# Day 5: Capstone Project - Google Slides Content

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title**: Designing Ethical AI Solutions  
**Subtitle**: Your Turn to Shape the Future of Technology  
**Visual**: Diverse students presenting tech projects  
**Notes**:  
- Start with "This week you've learned to think critically about AI - now you'll create solutions!"  
- Emphasize student agency in technology design

## Slide 2: The AI Designer's Mindset
**Content**:  
"Three Key Questions for Ethical Design:  
1. **Who benefits?** (Consider all stakeholders)  
2. **What could go wrong?** (Anticipate unintended consequences)  
3. **How will we know?** (Create feedback mechanisms)"  
**Visual**: Design thinking process graphic  
**Notes**:  
- Connect to previous days' case studies  
- Provide concrete examples from catalog

## Slide 3: Project Options
**Visual**: Three project pathway icons  
**Content**:  
"Choose Your Challenge:  
- **Deepfake Detector**: Help identify manipulated media  
- **Eco-AI Advisor**: Reduce environmental impact of recommendations  
- **Accessibility Enhancer**: Improve tools for diverse learners"  
**Support**:  
"All options use tools we've practiced (Scratch/Colab/Teachable Machine)"  
**Notes**:  
- Show sample outputs for each option  
- Emphasize no coding perfection required

## Slide 4: Design Framework
**Visual**: Project template screenshot  
**Content**:  
"Your Design Must Include:  
✓ Clear problem statement  
✓ Technical approach (with tool choice)  
✓ At least 2 ethical safeguards  
✓ Expected impact on real people"  
**Example**:  
"Deepfake detector that:  
- Uses Teachable Machine to spot inconsistencies  
- Includes 'uncertainty' warnings for borderline cases  
- Protects user privacy with on-device processing"  
**Notes**:  
- Walk through template structure  
- Highlight ethical safeguards section

## Slide 5: Ethical Design Checklist
**Visual**: Checklist graphic with icons  
**Content**:  
"Before finalizing your design:  
☐ Have I considered diverse user needs?  
☐ Is there a human oversight mechanism?  
☐ How does this handle edge cases?  
☐ What data is collected and why?  
☐ Is the system transparent about its limitations?"  
**Notes**:  
- Reference ethical dilemmas catalog entries  
- Provide printed checklist in resources

## Slide 6: Design Sprint Process
**Visual**: Timeline graphic  
**Content**:  
"90-Minute Design Sprint:  
0-20 min: Problem definition & research  
20-50 min: Prototype development  
50-75 min: Peer feedback & refinement  
75-90 min: Final presentation prep"  
**Teacher Support**:  
"Circulating with targeted questions:  
- 'How does this address bias?'  
- 'What's your fallback if AI fails?'"  
**Notes**:  
- Display timer for each phase  
- Emphasize iteration over perfection

## Slide 7: Peer Feedback Protocol
**Visual**: Feedback circle diagram  
**Content**:  
"Constructive Feedback Formula:  
1. 'I appreciate how you...'  
2. 'Have you considered...?'  
3. 'What if...?'  
**Example**:  
'I appreciate how you included uncertainty warnings. Have you considered how this affects processing speed? What if we added user customization?'"  
**Notes**:  
- Model appropriate feedback language  
- Provide sentence starters on handout

## Slide 8: Presentation Guidelines
**Visual**: Presentation rubric highlights  
**Content**:  
"Your 2-Minute Pitch Must:  
✓ State the problem clearly  
✓ Explain your technical approach simply  
✓ Highlight ethical considerations  
✓ Show one prototype element  
**Pro Tip**:  
"Imagine explaining to your grandparents!"  
**Notes**:  
- Demonstrate good vs poor examples  
- Emphasize clarity over technical jargon

## Slide 9: Real-World Impact
**Visual**: Student project examples  
**Content**:  
"Your work matters because:  
- 73% of teens want more AI ethics education (Pew Research)  
- You're the generation that will shape AI's future  
- Ethical design starts with people like YOU"  
**Call to Action**:  
"Take your project beyond this week:  
- Share with school leadership  
- Enter AI ethics competitions  
- Teach younger students"  
**Notes**:  
- Show examples of student-led AI initiatives  
- Connect to career pathways

## Slide 10: Course Reflection & Next Steps
**Big Question**:  
*"What will you remember about AI ethics one year from now?"*  
**Visual**: Pathway graphic showing continued learning  
**Next Steps**:  
- Complete course evaluation  
- Download your project template  
- Join our optional alumni network  
**Final Thought**:  
"You're not just learning about AI - you're learning to humanize it."  
**Notes**:  
- Distribute completion certificates  
- Share resources for continued learning
