# Day 4: Real-World AI Applications

## Learning Objectives
- Analyze AI applications in educational settings
- Understand tradeoffs between safety and privacy
- Build a simple AI surveillance simulation
- Develop ethical guidelines for AI in schools

## Materials
- Computers with internet access
- [Teachable Machine project](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- Projector for Google Slides presentation
- Printed "Ethical Policy Cards" (provided in resources)

## Lesson Flow (90 minutes)

### Introduction: AI in Our School (20 min)
**Activity**:
1. **Recap** (5 min): "What ethical rules would you want in self-driving cars?"
2. **Google Slides**:
   - Show real examples of AI in schools (attendance tracking, safety monitoring)
   - Discuss: "Where have you seen AI at our school?"
   - Introduce today's focus: School surveillance systems

### Hands-on: AI Surveillance Simulation (30 min)
**Teachable Machine Activity - Classroom Monitor**:
1. Open [pre-configured Teachable Machine project](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/abc123/)
2. Students train model to recognize:
   - "Appropriate behavior" (sitting, working)
   - "Suspicious behavior" (standing, looking around)
3. Test with sample classroom scenarios
4. Class discussion: "What biases might this system have?"

*Teacher Tip*: Use webcam privacy covers when not actively demonstrating

### Ethics Deep Dive: School Surveillance (25 min)
**Case Study Implementation**:
1. Present real cases of AI proctoring software issues (simplified)
2. Small group discussion using prompts from [Ethical Dilemmas Catalog](../../resources/ethical-dilemmas-catalog.md)
3. Policy development: "Create a student Bill of Rights for AI in schools"

### Reflection & Journaling (15 min)
**Prompt**:  
*"Create a 'Bill of Rights' for students using AI in schools. What 3 rights are most important?"*

**Sharing Protocol**:  
- Think: 3 minutes private drafting
- Pair: Combine ideas with partner
- Share: Groups present one key right for inclusion

## Teacher Resources
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Teachable Machine not loading? Use offline version (download from resources)
  - Privacy concerns? Emphasize we're using synthetic data only
- **Differentiation**:
  - Support: Provide template for Bill of Rights
  - Challenge: Research real school AI policies and compare
- **Assessment**:
  - Exit ticket: "One tradeoff between safety and privacy in AI is..."

## Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Test Teachable Machine project on classroom computers
- [ ] Prepare printed "Ethical Policy Cards"
- [ ] Create sample classroom scenarios
