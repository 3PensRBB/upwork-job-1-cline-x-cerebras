# Day 3: Python AI Fundamentals - Google Slides Content

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title**: From Blocks to Code  
**Subtitle**: Building Your First AI Model with Python  
**Visual**: Side-by-side Scratch blocks and Python code  
**Notes**:  
- Start with "Yesterday we designed algorithms - today we'll code them!"  
- Emphasize this is a natural progression from Scratch

## Slide 2: Why Python for AI?
**Content**:  
"Python: The Language of AI Developers  
- Simple syntax (reads like English)  
- Powerful libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)  
- Used by professionals worldwide"  
**Visual**: Logo collage (Python, Google, NASA)  
**Notes**:  
- Address fears: "We'll focus on understanding, not perfect syntax"  
- Connect to students' prior Scratch experience

## Slide 3: Google Colab Introduction
**Visual**: Colab interface screenshot  
**Content**:  
"Why we're using Google Colab:  
✓ No installation needed  
✓ Free access to powerful computers  
✓ Easy sharing and collaboration  
✓ Built-in AI tools"  
**Demo**:  
Quick tour of Colab interface (cells, run button, sharing)  
**Notes**:  
- Highlight "File → Save a copy in Drive" for student work

## Slide 4: Machine Learning Refresher
**Visual**: Updated ML pipeline graphic  
**Content**:  
"Today's Focus: Classification  
1. **Data**: Traffic light images (red/yellow/green)  
2. **Features**: Color, shape, position  
3. **Model**: Decision Tree (simple rules)  
4. **Predictions**: 'Stop', 'Caution', 'Go'"  
**Analogy**:  
"Like teaching a friend with flashcards: show examples until they learn"  
**Notes**:  
- Connect to Day 2's recommendation system concepts

## Slide 5: Code Comparison
**Visual**: Side-by-side Scratch vs Python  
**Scratch**:  
`when green flag clicked  
if <color = red> then  
  say [Stop] for 2 secs  
end`  
**Python**:  
`if color == "red":  
    print("Stop")`  
**Notes**:  
- Emphasize conceptual similarity  
- Explain syntax differences gently

## Slide 6: Traffic Light Classifier
**Interactive Demo**:  
1. Load dataset (show sample images)  
2. Train model (visualize decision tree)  
3. Test predictions (student input examples)  
**Key Concept**:  
"Models learn patterns from data, but can make mistakes!"  
**Notes**:  
- Demonstrate with concrete examples  
- Show how more data improves accuracy

## Slide 7: Activity Instructions
**Google Colab Traffic Light Project**  
**Steps**:  
1. Open notebook at [shortened link]  
2. Run cells in order (shift+enter)  
3. Test with new examples  
4. Record accuracy rates  
**Data Table Template**:  
| Test Image | Prediction | Correct? |  
|------------|------------|----------|  
| Red light  | Stop       | Yes      |  
| Yellow foggy | Go      | No       |  
**Notes**:  
- Emphasize pair programming approach  
- Provide error decoder reference sheet

## Slide 8: Ethics Deep Dive
**Autonomous Vehicle Scenarios**  
**Visual**: Simple trolley problem diagram  
**Discussion Prompt**:  
"If a self-driving car must choose between:  
- Hitting 1 pedestrian  
- Swerving and risking 3 passengers  
What rule should it follow?"  
**Notes**:  
- Keep scenarios concrete and age-appropriate  
- Reference Tesla autopilot limitations

## Slide 9: Reflection Prompt
**Big Question**:  
*"If you were in a self-driving car, what ethical rule would you want it to follow? Why?"*  
**Visual**: Car dashboard with ethical choice options  
**Notes**:  
- Allow private writing time first  
- Use "Think-Pair-Share" protocol

## Slide 10: Resources & Preview
**For Students**:  
- [Colab Notebook Link]  
- [Python for AI Cheat Sheet]  
**Preview Day 4**:  
"Tomorrow: AI in schools - surveillance vs safety"  
**Notes**:  
- Share resources via classroom system  
- Collect exit tickets before dismissal
