# Day 3: Python AI Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Transition from block-based to text-based programming for AI
- Understand basic machine learning concepts using scikit-learn
- Build and test a simple classification model
- Analyze ethical implications of autonomous decision-making

## Materials
- Computers with internet access
- Google Colab notebooks (no installation required)
- Projector for Google Slides presentation
- Printed "Ethical Decision Cards" (provided in resources)

## Lesson Flow (90 minutes)

### Introduction: From Blocks to Code (20 min)
**Activity**:
1. **Recap** (5 min): "How did algorithms affect wellbeing in yesterday's activity?"
2. **Google Slides**:
   - Compare Scratch blocks to Python code (visual side-by-side)
   - Introduce Google Colab as our coding environment
   - Show simple classification example (fruit vs vegetable)

### Hands-on: First ML Model in Python (30 min)
**Google Colab Activity - Traffic Light Classifier**:
1. Open [pre-configured Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/123456789)
2. Students explore:
   - Loading sample traffic light dataset
   - Training a simple decision tree model
   - Testing with new examples
3. Class discussion: "How does this compare to our Scratch activities?"

*Teacher Tip*: Have students work in pairs - one navigates, one types

### Ethics Deep Dive: Autonomous Vehicles (25 min)
**Case Study Implementation**:
1. Present Tesla autopilot decision-making scenarios (simplified)
2. Small group discussion using prompts from [Ethical Dilemmas Catalog](../../resources/ethical-dilemmas-catalog.md)
3. Role-play: "You're programming an ethical self-driving car - what rules would you implement?"

### Reflection & Journaling (15 min)
**Prompt**:  
*"If you were in a self-driving car, what ethical rule would you want it to follow? Why?"*

**Sharing Protocol**:  
- Think: 3 minutes private writing
- Pair: Share with partner
- Share: Groups present one key ethical consideration

## Teacher Resources
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Colab not loading? Use backup notebook in resources
  - Python errors? Focus on understanding over syntax (provide error decoder sheet)
- **Differentiation**:
  - Support: Pre-filled code cells with blanks to complete
  - Challenge: Modify model parameters to improve accuracy
- **Assessment**:
  - Exit ticket: "One difference between Scratch and Python for AI is..."

## Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Test Colab notebook on classroom computers
- [ ] Prepare printed "Ethical Decision Cards"
- [ ] Create student pairing chart
