# Day 1: Introduction to AI Ethics - Google Slides Content

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title**: What is AI?  
**Subtitle**: Understanding Artificial Intelligence in Our Daily Lives  
**Visual**: Cartoon robot interacting with students  
**Notes**:  
- Start with "Raise your hand if you've used AI today!"  
- Explain we'll explore both cool capabilities and important ethical questions

## Slide 2: AI Definition
**Content**:  
"AI is computer systems that can do things that normally require human intelligence"  
**Examples**:  
- Recognizing faces in photos  
- Recommending videos you might like  
- Translating languages instantly  
**Non-examples**:  
- Basic calculators  
- Simple timers  
**Notes**:  
- Emphasize "normally require human intelligence" as key differentiator  
- Ask: "Why isn't a calculator AI?"

## Slide 3: Where We See AI
**Interactive Activity**: "Spot the AI"  
**Images**:  
1. Netflix recommendations (AI)  
2. Digital thermometer (NOT AI)  
3. TikTok "For You" page (AI)  
4. Basic spellcheck (NOT AI)  
**Notes**:  
- Have students vote using thumbs up/down  
- Reveal answers with explanations  
- Connect to their daily experiences

## Slide 4: How AI Learns
**Visual**: Simple training data diagram  
**Content**:  
"AI learns from examples, just like you!"  
- More data = better learning  
- Biased data = biased AI  
**Analogy**:  
"Teaching a friend to recognize dogs by showing pictures - what happens if all pictures are golden retrievers?"  
**Notes**:  
- Use whiteboard to sketch how training works  
- Connect to upcoming Scratch activity

## Slide 5: Gender Shades Case Study
**Visual**: Simplified infographic showing error rates  
**Content**:  
- Commercial AI had 34% higher error rates for darker-skinned women  
- Why? Training data mostly light-skinned men  
**Discussion Prompt**:  
"What problems could this cause in real life?"  
**Notes**:  
- Keep statistics age-appropriate (avoid overwhelming numbers)  
- Focus on impact rather than technical details

## Slide 6: Bias in Action
**Interactive Poll**:  
"Which of these could be affected by biased AI?"  
- Hiring tools  
- School security cameras  
- Math homework apps  
- All of the above  
**Notes**:  
- Reveal answer: All of the above  
- Briefly explain each connection  
- Transition to hands-on activity

## Slide 7: Activity Instructions
**Scratch Fairness Checker**  
**Steps**:  
1. Open project at [shortened link]  
2. Test different profiles  
3. Record accuracy rates  
**Data Table Template**:  
| Profile | Accuracy |  
|---------|----------|  
| Light skin, male | 95% |  
| Dark skin, female | 65% |  
**Notes**:  
- Demonstrate first test case together  
- Emphasize recording observations

## Slide 8: Reflection Prompt
**Big Question**:  
"If you were designing a facial recognition system for your school, what 3 rules would you create to make it fair for everyone?"  
**Visual**: Thought bubble with diverse student faces  
**Notes**:  
- Allow private thinking time first  
- Use "Think-Pair-Share" protocol as described in lesson plan

## Slide 9: Daily Challenge
**Homework**:  
"Find one example of AI in your home tonight and think:  
- What data might it use?  
- Could it have bias?"  
**Visual**: Smartphone with AI icons  
**Notes**:  
- Provide example: "When Alexa misunderstands your accent"  
- Collect responses at start of Day 2

## Slide 10: Resources
**For Students**:  
- [Scratch Project Link]  
- [Simple AI Glossary]  
**For Parents**:  
- [Parent Information Session Details]  
- [Family Discussion Guide]  
**Notes**:  
- Share these links via classroom management system  
- Mention parent workshop opportunity
