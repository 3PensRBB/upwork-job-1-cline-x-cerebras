# Day 1: Introduction to AI Ethics

## Learning Objectives
- Define artificial intelligence in age-appropriate terms
- Recognize that AI systems can reflect human biases
- Understand the impact of biased AI through real-world examples

## Materials
- Computers with internet access
- [Scratch Fairness Checker Activity](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all)
- Projector for Google Slides presentation

## Lesson Flow (90 minutes)

### Introduction: What is AI? (20 min)
**Activity**: 
1. **Brainstorm** (5 min): "Where have you encountered AI today?" (voice assistants, game NPCs, social media)
2. **Google Slides**: 
   - Simple definition: "AI is computer systems that can do things that normally require human intelligence"
   - Visual examples: Show AI in action (e.g., Google Translate, TikTok recommendations)
   - Interactive poll: "Which of these is AI?" (show examples like calculators vs. self-driving cars)

### Hands-on: Bias in AI Systems (30 min)
**Scratch Activity - Fairness Checker Simulation**:
1. Load [pre-configured Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/123456789/) (template provided)
2. Students input different demographic profiles:
   - Skin tone sliders (light to dark)
   - Gender options
   - Age ranges
3. Record accuracy rates for different groups
4. Class discussion: "What patterns do you notice?"

*Teacher Tip*: If internet issues occur, use the backup dataset in `resources/bias-dataset.csv`

### Ethics Deep Dive: Facial Recognition (25 min)
**Case Study Implementation**:
1. Show Gender Shades findings (simplified infographic)
2. Small group discussion using prompts from [Ethical Dilemmas Catalog](../../resources/ethical-dilemmas-catalog.md)
3. Role-play: "You're a city council member - should we allow police to use facial recognition?"

### Reflection & Journaling (15 min)
**Prompt**:  
*"If you were designing a facial recognition system for your school, what 3 rules would you create to make it fair for everyone?"*

**Sharing Protocol**:  
- Think: 3 minutes private writing
- Pair: Share with one partner
- Share: 2 groups present key ideas

## Teacher Resources
- **Troubleshooting**: 
  - Scratch not loading? Use offline editor (download from scratch.mit.edu/download)
  - Confusion about bias? Show [this 2-min video](https://example.com/bias-explainer)
- **Differentiation**:
  - Support: Provide sentence starters for journaling
  - Challenge: Have students modify the Scratch project to improve fairness
- **Assessment**: 
  - Exit ticket: "One thing I learned about AI today is..."

## Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Test Scratch project on classroom computers
- [ ] Print discussion prompt cards
- [ ] Prepare sample datasets for offline use
