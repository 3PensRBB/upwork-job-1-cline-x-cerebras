# Parent Information Session: AI Crash Course for Middle Schoolers

## Welcome Message
Dear Parents and Guardians,

We're excited to introduce our **5-day AI Crash Course** designed specifically for middle school students (ages 11-14). This program balances hands-on technical learning with critical ethical discussions to prepare students for a future shaped by artificial intelligence.

## Why AI Education Matters
- **Relevance**: AI already impacts students' daily lives through social media, games, and school tools
- **Career readiness**: 90% of future jobs will require AI literacy (World Economic Forum)
- **Critical thinking**: Helps students become informed consumers and creators of technology
- **Ethical foundation**: Develops skills to navigate complex moral questions in digital spaces

## Course Highlights
✅ **No prior experience needed** - Starts with block-based coding (Scratch)  
✅ **Ethics-first approach** - Every lesson includes real-world case studies  
✅ **Hands-on activities** - Students build AI simulations they can share with family  
✅ **Web-based tools** - No software installation required (works on school Chromebooks)  

## Key Ethical Topics Covered
| Topic | Real-World Connection | Student Activity |
|-------|------------------------|------------------|
| Facial Recognition Bias | Joy Buolamwini's Gender Shades research | Build fairness checker in Scratch |
| Social Media Algorithms | Instagram's impact on teen mental health | Design "healthy algorithm" prototype |
| AI & Privacy | School surveillance systems | Create student Bill of Rights |
| Deepfakes | Celebrity misinformation cases | Develop media literacy PSAs |

## How You Can Support Learning
1. **Discussion starters**:
   - "What AI tools did you use today?"
   - "How might this technology affect people differently?"
   - "What rules should we have for AI in our home?"

2. **Family activities**:
   - Try Google's [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) together
   - Play "Spot the AI" during screen time (e.g., Netflix recommendations)
   - Discuss recent news about AI (we'll share age-appropriate articles)

3. **Safety guidelines**:
   - All student projects stay within school-approved platforms
   - No personal data collection in activities
   - Strict moderation of online interactions

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Will students be using social media platforms?**  
A: No - all activities use educational platforms like Scratch and Google Teachable Machine with school-safe configurations.

**Q: How is student privacy protected?**  
A: Activities are designed to use synthetic data (no real personal information). Any student-created content remains on school devices.

**Q: What if my child struggles with the technical aspects?**  
A: The course includes multiple entry points - students can focus on ethical discussions while building confidence with coding.

## Next Steps
