# Ethical Dilemmas Catalog for AI Crash Course

## Core Ethical Framework
Each dilemma follows this structure:
- **Real-world case study** (age-appropriate example)
- **Discussion prompts** (guided questions for classroom)
- **Hands-on activity** (Scratch/Python implementation)
- **Reflection prompt** (journaling exercise)

## Facial Recognition Bias
**Case Study**: Joy Buolamwini's Gender Shades project revealed commercial AI systems had 34% higher error rates for darker-skinned women vs lighter-skinned men.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Why might AI systems perform worse for certain groups?
- How could this affect real-world applications like police surveillance?
- What steps can developers take to prevent bias?

**Activity**:
1. Use Scratch to create a "fairness checker" simulation
2. Input different skin tone/demographic combinations
3. Observe how biased training data affects outcomes

**Reflection Prompt**:  
*"If you were designing a facial recognition system for your school, what 3 rules would you create to make it fair for everyone?"*

---

## Social Media Algorithms
**Case Study**: Instagram's algorithm promotes content that keeps users scrolling, which has been linked to increased anxiety in teens.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Should social media optimize for "time spent" or "user wellbeing"?
- How might different goals change the algorithm's design?
- What responsibility do platforms have for mental health impacts?

**Activity**:
1. Build a simple recommendation algorithm in Scratch
2. Adjust parameters to prioritize either engagement or wellbeing
3. Compare outcomes using sample user profiles

**Reflection Prompt**:  
*"Design an algorithm that would make your favorite app healthier to use. What would it change?"*

---

## Autonomous Vehicles
**Case Study**: Self-driving cars must make split-second decisions in accident scenarios (e.g., swerve to avoid pedestrians but risk passenger safety).

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Should cars prioritize passenger safety or pedestrian safety?
- How would you program ethical decision-making?
- Who should decide these rules (engineers, governments, public)?

**Activity**:
1. Create a "trolley problem" simulator in Scratch
2. Program different ethical frameworks (utilitarian, deontological)
3. Test scenarios with varying numbers of pedestrians/occupants

**Reflection Prompt**:  
*"If you were in a self-driving car, what ethical rule would you want it to follow? Why?"*

---

## School Surveillance
**Case Study**: AI proctoring software flags students for "suspicious behavior" during exams, disproportionately affecting neurodivergent students.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- What privacy rights should students have in digital classrooms?
- How might AI monitoring create unfair advantages/disadvantages?
- When does safety justify surveillance?

**Activity**:
1. Design a classroom monitoring system in Scratch
2. Implement privacy-preserving features (e.g., data anonymization)
3. Debate tradeoffs between security and freedom

**Reflection Prompt**:  
*"Create a 'Bill of Rights' for students using AI in schools. What 3 rights are most important?"*

---

## Deepfake Technology
**Case Study**: AI-generated videos of celebrities used in scams and misinformation campaigns.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- How can we verify if digital content is real?
- Should deepfake creation tools be restricted?
- What makes something "ethical" to create/share?

**Activity**:
1. Build a "media authenticity checker" in Scratch
2. Analyze sample images/videos for manipulation clues
3. Create PSA videos about digital literacy

**Reflection Prompt**:  
*"Design a school assembly about spotting deepfakes. What would you teach your classmates?"*

---

## Environmental Impact
**Case Study**: Training large AI models consumes massive energy (e.g., equivalent to 5 cars' lifetime emissions).

**Discussion Prompts**:
- How should we balance AI benefits with environmental costs?
- What can developers do to reduce AI's carbon footprint?
- Should users know the environmental cost of AI services?

**Activity**:
1. Create an energy calculator in Scratch
2. Compare emissions of different AI tasks
3. Propose "green AI" design principles

**Reflection Prompt**:  
*"If you were an AI developer, what 3 eco-friendly practices would you implement?"*

---

## Accessibility Tools
**Case Study**: AI-powered captioning helps deaf students, but accuracy varies across dialects and accents.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- How can AI improve accessibility while avoiding new barriers?
- Why might some groups be left out of accessibility solutions?
- What makes technology truly inclusive?

**Activity**:
1. Build a voice recognition accessibility tool in Scratch
2. Test with different accents/speech patterns
3. Propose improvements for underrepresented groups

**Reflection Prompt**:  
*"Design an AI tool that would help someone with a disability you care about. How would it work?"*
